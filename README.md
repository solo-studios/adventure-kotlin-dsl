# Adventure Kotlin DSL

This is a replacement for [adventure-extra-kotlin](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure/tree/main/4/extra-kotlin),
that adds a kotlin DSL for creating components and automatically appending them as children if applicable.

It also contains various kotlin-style functions, such as:

```kotlin
"minecraft:whatever".toKey()
```
